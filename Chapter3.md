Once I'm done with my 2:40 am class, I try to get some food before going for dancing rehearsals.
Usually, I get some cafe mac burgers with sprite (I think I'm addicted to it, just like falafel) from caribou.
Other times, I try to find where there is some free food on campus.
I cry when I don't find any, I just starve and head off to ensemble.
