Once I'm done with my 3:30 class, I try to get some food before going for ensemble rehearsals.
Usually, I get some pretzel buns with sprite (I think I'm addicted to it) from breadsmith.
Other times, I try to find where there is some free food on campus.
But when I don't find any, I just starve and head off to ensemble.
