Sam was a bright kid.
He also had a beautiful voice.
On Sam's first birthday, he sang his first note.
His note was so beautiful, the world stopped to listen to his note.
On Sam's second birthday, he sang an even more beautiful note.
Again the world stopped to hear him sing.
On Sam's third birthday, he sang an even more beautiful note.
The entire world stopped to listen to him singing.
An entire crowd was gathered around his bedside when he sang that day.
And so the world waited for the next year for Sam to sing his beautiful note.
They waited in anticipation, all excited to hear Sam top his last note.
They were not disappointed.
On Sam's fourth year, he sang his most beautiful note.
The world stopped, absolutely speechless.
And yet, Sam sang even more beautiful on his 5th and 6th year.
But on his 7th year, something felt off.
Something was wrong.
Sam began to sing, but it sounded screechy.
And then he spotaneously combusted.
Everybody cried and suffered for the next decade.
Finally, someone asked why he combusted.
A monk said: Sam sung note 7.
The note 7 said boom boom paw
I like that boom boom pow
Them chickens jackin' my style
They try copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 3008
You so 2000 and late
I got that boom, boom, boom
That future boom, boom, boom
Let me get it now
Boom boom boom, gotta get-get
Boom boom boom, gotta get-get
