Every morning, I wake up at 5 o'clock
I brush my teeth then go for a a 12 mile run
the gym opens at 6, so I go for my morning lift where I bench 5000 pounds
after that, I swim to cafe mac to have a high protein breakfast
I took two 8 am classes at the same time because I don't want to waste my morning.
I attend one in person while attending the other on zoom for maximum productivity.
