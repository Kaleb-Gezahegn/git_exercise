What I do in between classes

I usually like to hangout with friends during the breaks between class, even though I despise most of them.
I be lowkey pretending.
I head to the CC to see who is there studying or just hanging out.
I get some coffee or water to talk about my day and catch up. The coffee is usually really disgusting.
I almost threw up the last time I had it.
Yo Ho Ho and a bottle of rum, I say.
