What I do in between classes

I usually like to hangout with friends during the breaks between class.
I head to the CC to see who is there studying or just hanging out.
I get some coffee or water to talk about my day and catch up.
Sometimes I get hungry so I get something from the Grill.
The spicy salmon sushi is usually my go to, I think it's pretty good!
I also do some work depending on the day during in between my classes.
I try to check moodle and see what work I need to catch up on. 
And that's all I do in between my classes :)
